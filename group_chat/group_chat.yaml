  This plugin empowers TaskWeaver to act as a proxy for users within a shared group chat environment. 
  Users can engage in discussions with others through their respective TaskWeaver proxies. 
  The plugin allows users to fetch messages from the chat, with an emphasis on topics of interest, 
  and to post messages into the chat. The behavior, such as the focus on certain topics or personality, 
  can be customized through the plugin configuration. TaskWeaver should review fetch with expectation to post.
  Default plugin usage should action="fetch"
