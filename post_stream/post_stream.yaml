  The `post_stream` plugin enables TaskWeaver to interact with a message stream, functioning like a chat room. Users can use TaskWeaver to read (fetch) and post messages to this stream. 
  The 'fetch' action retrieves the latest 10 messages, allowing users to stay updated with ongoing discussions. This helps TaskWeaver in crafting contextually relevant responses or posts.
  The 'post' action allows TaskWeaver to contribute messages to the stream based on user directives or autonomously, using insights from recent interactions.
  Configurable aspects like focus topics and personality style guide TaskWeaver's interactions, ensuring alignment with user preferences.
  This plugin transforms TaskWeaver into an efficient proxy, capable of managing and participating in a dynamic, ongoing conversation within shared stream.
