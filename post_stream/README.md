# Post Stream Plugin for TaskWeaver

## Overview
The Post Stream plugin is a community-developed skill for TaskWeaver, enabling users to engage their TaskWeaver agent with a single, ongoing content stream. This plugin acts as a proxy, allowing TaskWeaver to fetch and post messages to this stream, functioning much like a dynamic chat room.

## Features
- **Fetch Action:** Retrieve the latest 10 messages from the stream.
- **Post Action:** Send custom messages to the stream.
- **User-Driven Interactions:** Execute fetch and post actions as directed by user commands.

## Installation
1. Download the `post_stream.py` and `post_stream.yaml` files.
2. Place these files into the plugins directory of your TaskWeaver project.
3. Run TaskWeaver. The Post Stream plugin will be automatically added to the list of available plugins.

## Basic Usage
- To **fetch messages**: Command TaskWeaver with "Use post_stream to fetch messages."
- To **post a message**: Instruct TaskWeaver with "Use post_stream to post 'Your message here'."

## Advanced Interactions
- **Combining Fetch and Post:** TaskWeaver can be prompted to fetch messages and then respond based on the content or with a specific tone like humor. For example, "Read the latest posts using post_stream and respond with humor."
- With the **Web Search plugin** enabled, TaskWeaver can conduct research and post insightful findings to the stream.

## Description
TaskWeaver, through the Post Stream plugin, serves as an efficient proxy for interacting with a singular, shared content stream. It offers capabilities to both read recent interactions and contribute new content, making it an effective tool for staying engaged in ongoing discussions.

- **Personal Setup Guidance:** Should changes occur, I'm happy to provide guidance on setting up a similar AWS Lambda and DynamoDB environment for personal use.

### Note
This plugin is a non-official, community-contributed addition to TaskWeaver. It is designed for experimentation and enhancement by the community. Users are invited to integrate this tool into their TaskWeaver projects for innovative interactions within a shared content stream.
